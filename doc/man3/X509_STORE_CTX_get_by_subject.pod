=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509_vfy.h>

 int X509_STORE_CTX_get_by_subject(const X509_STORE_CTX *vs,
                                   X509_LOOKUP_TYPE type,
                                   const X509_NAME *name, X509_OBJECT *ret);
 X509_OBJECT *X509_STORE_CTX_get_obj_by_subject(X509_STORE_CTX *vs,
                                                X509_LOOKUP_TYPE type,
                                                const X509_NAME *name);
 STACK_OF(X509_OBJECT) *X509_STORE_CTX_get1_objs_by_auth(X509_STORE_CTX *ctx,
                                                         const X509_NAME *name,
                                                         const ASN1_OCTET_STRING *akid);
=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_STORE_CTX_get_by_subject() tries to find an object
of given I<type>, which may be B<X509_LU_X509> or B<X509_LU_CRL>,
and subject I<name> from the store in the provided store context I<vs>.
If found and I<ret> is not NULL, it increments the reference count and
stores the looked up object in I<ret>.

X509_STORE_CTX_get_obj_by_subject() is like X509_STORE_CTX_get_by_subject()
but returns the found object on success, else NULL.

X509_STORE_CTX_get1_objs_by_auth() finds all certificates in the store that
match the given subject I<name> and, if provided, the authority key ID I<akid>.
If both I<name> and I<akid> are supplied, the function requires both values
to match. The authority key ID is matched against the subject key ID of the
certificates in the store. Certificates are matched in the order they
are stored.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509_STORE_CTX_get_by_subject() returns 1 if the lookup was successful, else 0.

X509_STORE_CTX_get_obj_by_subject() returns an object on success, else NULL.

X509_STORE_CTX_get1_objs_by_auth() returns a new stack with pointers to all
matching certificates in the store. The caller must free the returned stack.
If no certificate matches the given subject, an empty stack is returned.
In case of any error, NULL is returned.
